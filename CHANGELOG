CHANGELOG
=========

2.9.0
-----

2019-01-03

This is a backwards compatible feature and bugfix release.

### Added

  * New `change_hostname` config setting that controls whether the provisioner
    will attempt to set the hostname of the VM.

### Fixed

  * Hostnames can now be removed from Windows VMs.

  * Provisioning hostnames on Windows VMs will no longer fail when a large
    number of names is added.

2.8.2
-----

2018-08-16

This is a backwards compatible bugfix release.

  * Fixed a "undefined method 'split' for nil" error with get_default_iface
    that affects Vagrant 1.9 and newer.


2.8.2
-----

2018-06-05

This is a backwards compatible bugfix release.

  * The `exports` and `imports` attributes of the hosts provisioner now
    properly merge when a provisioner with the same name is definied in
    multiple scopes (e.g. global, per-vm, per-provider).

  * Added test coverage for Vagrant 2.1.


2.8.1
-----

2018-05-02

This is a backwards compatible bugfix release.

  * Added test coverage for Vagrant 1.9 and 2.0

  * Deprecated support for vagrant versions earlier than 1.8. These will be
    removed in the next major release.

  * Hostnames are now resolved to IP addresses using the Addrinfo library
    which wraps the system resolver. Previously the Resolv library was used
    which is a pure-Ruby DNS resolver that did not pick up system-specific
    configuration or behavior.

  * Host synchronization is supported for FreeBSD, thanks to Brian Shumate.

  * Errors that occur during host sync are now trapped and logged. This
    means that an unreachable host will no longer block other operations
    like `vagrant destroy`.


2.8.0
-----

2016-04-18

This is a backwards compatible feature release.

  * (GH-56) Added a special value, `@facter_ipaddress`, for host entries that

  * (GH-56) Added a special value, `@vagrant_ssh`, for host entries that will

  * (GH-61) Fixed a bug where config_builder 0.x couldn't set the hosts array
